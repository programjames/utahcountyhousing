# Utah County Housing

This uses information that Utah County puts out to show real estate information for your house in a cleaner format. The search feature is a little awkward because it is taken
from <http://www.utahcounty.gov/LandRecords/AddressSearchForm.asp>.

## Currently not working.
The server it was hosted on got reset, and there are no plans to reinstall this repository on it. If you would like to test it out yourself you will need to change the IP address for its CORS queries.
